Problem Description
You are given an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, you are given an integer array A.
You have to print the odd and even elements of array A in 2 separate lines.
NOTE: Array elements should have the same relative order as in A.
Problem Constraints
1 <= T <= 10	1 <= |A| <= 10^5	1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
Input Format
First line of the input contains a single integer T.
For each test case:
First line consists of a single integer |A| denoting the length of array.
Second line consists of |A| space separated integers denoting the elements of array A.
Output Format
For each test case:
First line should contain an array of space separated integers containing all the odd elements of array A
Second line should contain an array of space separated integers containing all the even elements of array A
Example Input
Input 1:
 2 
 5
 1 2 3 4 5
 3
 4 3 2
Input 2:
 2 
 3
 2 2 2
 2
 1 1
Example Output
Output 1:
 1 3 5
 2 4
 3
 4 2
Output 2:
 2 2 2
 1 1
Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Test Case 1: 
 Odd elements in the array(in the order they occur) are: 1, 3, 5.
 Even elements in the array(in the order they occur) are: 2, 4.
 Test Case 2 
 Odd elements in the array(in the order they occur) are: 3.
 Even elements in the array(in the order they occur) are: 4, 2.
Explanation 2:
 Test Case 1: 
 There are no odd elements in the array.
 Even elements in the array(in the order they occur) are: 2, 2, 2.
 Test Case 2 
 Odd elements in the array(in the order they occur) are: 1, 1.
 There are no even elements in the array.
