# Image Processing using NumPy

### Understanding image processing:
Image processing is the manipulation of digital images using algorithms and computer software. It involves analyzing, enhancing, and altering images to extract useful information or to improve their visual quality. Image processing techniques can be used to correct defects, remove noise or artifacts, enhance contrast or sharpness, and perform various measurements or analyses on the image data. Examples of image processing applications include medical imaging, satellite imagery, surveillance systems, digital photography, and computer vision.

### Lets try out some the IP using NumPy

NumPy is a popular Python library that provides support for numerical computations and manipulation of arrays, including arrays that represent images. Some of the image processing techniques that can be built using NumPy are:   
      - **Image Filtering**: NumPy provides functions to apply various types of filters to images, such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and noise reduction.  
      - **Image Transformation**: This technique involves altering the geometric properties of an image, such as rotation, scaling, or translation. NumPy provides functions to perform these operations.  
      - **Image Thresholding**: This technique involves converting an image to a binary form by setting pixels above or below a certain threshold to a specific value. NumPy provides functions to perform global or adaptive thresholding.        
      - **Image Morphology**: This technique involves modifying the shape of objects in an image, for example, by eroding or dilating the boundaries. NumPy provides functions for these operations.  
      - **Histogram Equalization**: This technique involves modifying the distribution of pixel values in an image to improve its contrast. NumPy provides a function to perform histogram equalization  .
      - **Image Segmentation**: This technique involves dividing an image into regions based on some criteria, such as color or texture. NumPy provides functions for performing segmentation using clustering or thresholding.  

These are just some examples of the many image processing techniques that can be built using NumPy. NumPy can be used in combination with other libraries, such as OpenCV or scikit-image, to perform more complex image processing tasks.
